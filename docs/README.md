Language Library
================

Oh dear, I need a better name for this.

Motivation
----------

The point of this project is to fill the gap between learning grammar rules and committing them to memory.
The real point is for me to learn Haskell and the latest and greatest JS libraries. It's also because
I really like grammar rules, even though I'm terrible at languages. I want to be a bit better at languages.
So many people say you should throw away your grammar books and just practice the language.
That's nice. But when I form mnemonics, I really, really like when they are actually based on the actual
rules that underly the language. I have my neverending set of flashcards, but it would be nicer if I
could just remember that darn rule of how to make plurals in Swedish. 

Right, so that's the motivation.

Overview
--------

This is how it will work for the user.

1. Make a set of rules using the templating system
2. Input a few words to these rules. It'll try to apply the rules, but you can make some exceptions.
3. It will give you a list of flashcards with special tags.
4. You load them into a flashcard program of your choice
5. Periodically, you download the flashcard stats, and upload them. My program will tell you
which rules you should probably review.
